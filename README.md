# REACT BASIC BOILERPLATE

This is a little bit "hipster" React project, using a kind of not usual patterns in his scope. However, I think that should be a great choice for a lot of reasons.
The stack is following:

---
* React
* Redux (with [ducks](https://github.com/erikras/ducks-modular-redux) concept)
* Jest
* Enzyme
* ESLint (with [Airbnb config](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) included)
* Webpack
* Webpack-dev-server
* Styled components

Besides that, the project is still missing some tools in stack that I will implement soon. Including the following:

---
* i18n (probably I'll use [react-intl](https://github.com/yahoo/react-intl))
* Flow

The source code has this follow structure:
```
├── components
│   ├── button.js
│   └── section.js
├── example
│   ├── duck.js
│   └── view.js
├── index.js
└── reducers.js
```
