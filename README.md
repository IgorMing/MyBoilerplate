# REACT BASIC BOILERPLATE

This is a little bit "hipster" React project, using a kind of not usual patterns in his scope. However, I think that should be a great choice for a lot of reasons.
The stack is following:
---
* React
* Redux (with ducks concept)
* Jest
* Enzyme
* ESLint (with Airbnb config included)
* Webpack
* Webpack-dev-server

Besides that, he project is still missing some tools in stack that I will implement soon. Including the following:
---
* Styled components
* i18n (probably I'll use [react-intl](https://github.com/yahoo/react-intl))
* Flow

The source code has this follow structure:
```
├── example
│   ├── duck.js
│   └── index.js
├── index.js
└── reducers.js
```
